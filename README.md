## #OMARG-OS: hey there! Let's look deeper on the links when you visit and compare to repo structure and create TODO for adding missing information here.

## Additional Resources I've found that will be later organized better here:
https://pugin.ai/ - A chatgpt plugin list that features more than just the built-in plugins.
./models/READme.md - contains a plugin list of the verified plugins accessible directly through ChatGPT Plugins model.
