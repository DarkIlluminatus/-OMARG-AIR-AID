## Introduction

Welcome to ARCHON - the AI Remote Holistic Controller. ARCHON serves as a versatile bridge, connecting any language models with RCON (Remote Console) and API systems, transforming them into a powerful, holistic control mechanism for various applications. It's designed to empower users with a highly configurable platform, integrating local NLP, API endpoints, and RCON instructions.

### Key Features

- **GPT Integration**: Seamlessly connects with any generative language models.
- **API & RCON Connectivity**: Offers on-the-fly API instruction generation and RCON management.
- **Advanced Web Browsing**: Enhances a model's existing web browsing capabilities, simulating an advanced OS-level web browser.
- **Customizable Training Data**: Users can define their training datasets, stored either locally or on a GitHub fork.
- **Entware Module & Custom Firmware**: Available as an Entware module or can be integrated into custom router firmware for advanced users.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Follows the terms and conditions of the -OMARG-AIR-AID project on darkilluminatus GitHub.
